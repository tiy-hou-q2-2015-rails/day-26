Day 26 - Gems that will Make your Day
============

Challenge
----

The rails app in `railsy` is broke -- the homepage does not show, and we need
you to figure out what's wrong. Our previous developer took a job at Fakebook,
so we need this done ASAP.

The site should look like this:

![railsy](assets/railsy.png)

Today
----

1. Session and Authentication
2. `has_secure_password`
3. `kaminari` (pagination)
4. `simple_form`
5. `carrierwave`


Homework
-------

1. Create a rails app that will store photos
1. Have ability to upload photos when you go to `/admin`
2. Show the photos on your `root_path`, but only 6 to a page (pagination)
3. Make sure when you upload your photos that you are resizing the photos to
   500px x 500px
4. Make sure that `/admin` is secured using `before_action` and
   `has_secure_password`

Notes
----

* you can get photos from http://lorempixel.com/ or http://www.webcak.es/#polish/images, or http://www.pexels.com/
* you'll basically use all gems we used today
