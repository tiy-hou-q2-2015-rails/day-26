Day 26 - Gems that will Make your Day
============

Challenge
----

The rails app in `railsy` is broke -- the homepage does not show, and we need
you to figure out what's wrong. Our previous developer took a job at Fakebook,
so we need this done ASAP.

The site should look like this:

![railsy](assets/railsy.png)

Today
